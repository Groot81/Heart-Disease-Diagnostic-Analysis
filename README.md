# Heart-Disease-Diagnostic-Analysis
------------Heart disease remains a significant global health concern, contributing to a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding the factors associated with heart disease prevalence is crucial for effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. In this analysis, we examine a dataset containing various demographic and clinical attributes of individuals, aiming to elucidate key trends and associations related to heart disease. By exploring factors such as gender, chest pain type, and the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, we seek to uncover insights that may inform risk assessment and intervention efforts. ------------
